```

To continue work:
1. Navigate to `/home/jupyter-stanley/SwS/website/astro/`
2. Run `npm run dev` to start development server
3. Check `CLAUDE.md` for detailed context
4. Review `BUILDPLAN.md` for next objectives

## 💡 Technical Notes

- Site is now using Astro's static output mode for better Vercel compatibility
- All pixel art images should use `image-rendering: pixelated` CSS
